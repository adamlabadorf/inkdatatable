This is an Inkscape extension that creates tables for reporting tabular values
like you see in spreadsheets. See example.svg/example.png for usage.

The install.sh script installs the extension into the user's Inkscape extensions
directory on linux systems.

TODOS
=====

  - The vertical alignment in cells is kind of hackish, try to improve it
  - Consider changing the cells from rects to clones with svg:use
