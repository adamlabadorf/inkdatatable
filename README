This is an Inkscape extension that creates tables for reporting tabular values
like you see in spreadsheets. See example.svg for usage.

The install.sh script installs the extension into the user's Inkscape extensions
directory on linux systems.

TODOS
=====

Consider adding an option to have a bounding box and grid lines to the table
The vertical alignment in cells is kind of hackish, try to improve it
