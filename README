This is an Inkscape extension that creates tables for reporting tabular values
like you see in spreadsheets. See example.svg for usage.

The install.sh script installs the extension into the user's Inkscape extensions
directory on linux systems.

TODOS
=====

  - Consider adding an option to have a bounding box and grid lines to the table
  - The vertical alignment in cells is kind of hackish, try to improve it
  - Would be REALLY awesome if you could give it a CSV file and it just figures
    everything out...but there's no text area parameter option for the
    configuration pane I can find, only text boxes which would really suck to use
